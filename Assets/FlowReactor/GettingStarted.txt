-----------------
Create New Graph
-----------------

1. 
Simply right click in your project view and select: Create / FlowReactor / New Graph

2.
You can now open the graph by a double click on the file or by clicking on the edit button in the inspector.


--------
Add Node
--------

1.
By default FlowReactor adds an OnStart node to a newly created graph.
Click and drag on the output of the OnStart node, release your mouse somewhere on the empty canvas to open up the node panel.

2.
Now search for the DebugLog node and add it to the canvas.
The two nodes has been connected automatically.

3.
Finally you can now add a text to the Debug.Log node. For this simply select the Debug.Log node, goto the node inspector and add a text to the log variable field.


---------
Run Graph
---------

1.
To run a graph in the scene we need to add it to a gameobject.

2a.
Create a new gameobject in your empty scene, then select your newly created graph and drag it onto the gameobject in the hierarchy view (not inspector). 
FlowReactor automatically adds the FlowReactorComponent to the gameobject with its assigned graph.

2b.
Alternatively you can add the FlowReactorComponent script to the game object and assign the graph to the empty graph field. 

3.
You can now run the scene and you should see your log message in the unity console.
