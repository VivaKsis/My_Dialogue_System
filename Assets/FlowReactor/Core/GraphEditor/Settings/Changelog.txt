- Bugfix: Fixed issue when coroutine node gets executed again before coroutine has finished. (Stop coroutine before executing new)
- Bugfix: Fixed issue when dragging new connection from node output too fast, nodepanel window would not stay open.


!!!!!!!! Breaking changes !!!!!!!!
1) 
Due to the newly introduced FRVariable exposing feature you will probably have to update your custom FRVariable types.
This should be fairly easy to do. Simply have a look at an existing FRVariable type like the FRString.
2)
If you have custom nodes please change following line in the DrawGUI method from:
base.DrawGUI("MyNode", _id, _graph, _editorSkin);
to:
base.DrawGUI(nodeData.title, _id, _graph, _editorSkin);
